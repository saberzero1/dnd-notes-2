# Flind
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 127, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 153*

When the demon lord Yeenoghu wants to create a particularly fearsome war band leader, he transforms an exceptionally strong and vicious gnoll into a demonic warrior known as a flind.

A war band of demon-worshiping gnolls typically contains only one flind, and that creature sets the war band's path. Because of its special connection to Yeenoghu, a flind uses demonic insight to guide the gnolls toward weak prey ripe for slaughter.

Unlike other leaders who might skulk behind their minions, a flind leads the charge in battle. Its flail causes wracking pain, paralysis, and disorientation in those it strikes.

***Multiattack.*** The flind makes one Flail of Chaos attack, one Flail of Pain attack, and one Flail of Paralysis attack, or it makes three Longbow attacks.

On a failed save, the target must use its reaction, if available, to make one melee attack against a random creature, other than the flind, within its reach.
