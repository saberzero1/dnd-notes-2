# Molydeus
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 184*  
![](Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/img/molydeus.webp#right)

The fearsome molydeus speaks for the demon lord it serves and enforces its master's will. This demon is 12 feet tall, and its bipedal body has a slavering wolfs head and a fanged serpent's head. Its demon lord can speak and see through the serpent head; this master also uses the molydeus to guard treasures, slay foes, and terrify troops into obedience.

A molydeus' demon lord bestows on it a powerful weapon that dissolves if the molydeus dies. The weapon's form varies depending on the creator, but that doesn't affect the weapon's capabilities.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the molydeus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The molydeus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The molydeus makes one Demonic Weapon attack, one Snakebite attack, and one Wolf Bite attack.

***Demonic Weapon.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+16` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 35 (`4d12 + 9`) force damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 27 (`6d8`) force damage from the hit.

***Snakebite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+16` to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 16 (`2d6 + 9`) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target transforms into a [manes](Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/manes.md) if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a [wish](Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell.

***Wolf Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+16` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (`3d10 + 9`) necrotic damage.

***Spellcasting.*** The molydeus casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22):

**At will:** [dispel magic](Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic-xphb.md), [polymorph](Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph-xphb.md), [telekinesis](Mechanics/CLI/spells/telekinesis-xphb.md), [teleport](Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport-xphb.md)

**3/day:** [lightning bolt](Mechanics/CLI/spells/lightning-bolt-xphb.md)

## Legendary Actions

Legendary Action Uses: 3. Immediately after another creature's turn, the molydeus can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The molydeus regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.

***Attack.*** The molydeus makes one Demonic Weapon or Snakebite attack.

***Move.*** The molydeus moves without provoking [opportunity attacks](Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack).

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** The molydeus uses Spellcasting.
