Bards are gifted poets, storytellers, and entertainers who travel far and wide. They're commonly found in taverns or in the company of jolly bands of adventurers, rough-and-tumble mercenaries, and wealthy patrons.

Each bard is a master of at least one type of performance. You may choose a bard's main type, or you may roll on the Bard [Performance](Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance) Types table to determine it.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bard makes two Shortsword or Shortbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Cacophony (Recharge 4-6).*** Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from the bard must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 9 (`2d8`) thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the bard. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

***Spellcasting.*** The bard casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

**At will:** [dancing lights](Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights-xphb.md), [mage hand](Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand-xphb.md), [prestidigitation](Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation-xphb.md)

**1/day each:** [charm person](Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person-xphb.md), [invisibility](Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility-xphb.md), [sleep](Mechanics/CLI/spells/sleep-xphb.md)

## Bonus Actions

***Taunt (2/Day).*** The bard targets one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard's next turn.
