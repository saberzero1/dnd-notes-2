***Level 5.*** Arcane Excellence. The cultist has a +1 bonus to its spell attack rolls and spell save DC. This bonus increases to +2 at Captain level 9, and +3 at Captain level 13.

***Level 5.*** Greater Curse. The cultist can choose the Necrotic Damage effect of its Eldritch Curse in addition to another effect. At Captain level 9, the Necrotic Damage effect deals `2d8` plus your Charisma modifier Necrotic damage.

## Actions

***Eldritch Curse.*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC equals your Cohort save DC, one creature within 60 feet. *Failure:* The cultist chooses one of the following effects.

***Bleeding.*** Until the start of the cultist's next turn, the target takes an extra `1d4` Necrotic damage whenever it takes damage.

***Evil Eye.*** The target has the [Frightened](Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition until the start of the cultist's next turn.

***Hobbled.*** The target's [Speed](Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is reduced to 10 feet until the start of the cultist's next turn.

This [Vulnerability](Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/vulnerability-xphb.md) ends early after the target takes the chosen type of damage.

## Reactions

***Level 13.*** Hellish Rebuke. The cultist casts [Hellish Rebuke](Mechanics/CLI/spells/hellish-rebuke-xphb.md) in response to the spell's trigger, using your Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC equals your Cohort save DC).
